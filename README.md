# OracleConsensusMVP


This project outlines and simulates a core component of a decentralized oracle system: a **resilient data aggregation engine** capable of reaching consensus on any data type (prices, strings, complex JSON) without relying on hardcoded keys. This is only a MVP and there is a lot of room for improvement.
It operates autonomously‚Äîit requires no predefined schemas or manual blacklists. This flexibility allows it to adapt instantly to any JSON data structure, from financial market feeds to complex data.

## üí° Core Principle: Adaptive and Liquid Consensus

The system achieves **"liquidity"** by abandoning type-specific aggregation (like averaging) in favor of **distance-based clustering**.

1. **Find the Center:** Calculate the difference between every single result.
2. **Identify the Best Fit:** Use the _Median Pairwise Distance (MPD)_ to select the result that sits most centrally among the majority of nodes.
3. **Confirm the Vote:** Verify that at least 60% of the network is clustered tightly around this "Best Fit" value.

## üõ†Ô∏è Mechanism Overview

The aggregation process is divided into **three key phases**:

### 1. Pre-Processing & Canonicalization

- **Canonicalization:** All successful JSON API responses are recursively sorted by key and converted into a comparable structure.  
  _This prevents minor format changes (e.g., key order) from failing consensus._

---

### 2. Distance Scoring (Recursive Semantic Distance)

The difference between any two JSON objects (JSON A and JSON B) is calculated by traversing the structure and applying **weighted penalties** based on the field type.

| Field Type           | Distance Metric                                                                 | Rationale                                              | Penalty Weight |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| String / Boolean     | Fixed Penalty (if mismatch)                                                     | Strict Consensus: Treats identifiers/statuses as critical. | 1000           |
| Numeric (Price, Temp)| Scaled Relative Difference (a percentage comparison)                        | Accepts minor legitimate deviation.                    | -              |
| Structural           | Fixed Penalty                                                                   | Critical Failure: Heavily penalizes schema tampering. | 5000           |

Uses Scaled Relative Difference (a percentage comparison). This penalizes a 10% price deviation far more heavily than a 0.01% market drift. The system is tuned to accept small, real-time volatility while rejecting major errors.

### 3. Outlier Defense & Final Vote

- **Robust Deviation Score (RDS):** For each node X, its deviation is calculated as the **median** of all its pairwise distances to every other node.

  - A single outlier‚Äôs large distance is ignored by the median calculation.
  - A legitimate node's RDS remains low, even if one node is malicious.

- **Best Fit Selection:** The node with the **lowest RDS** is chosen as the final result candidate.

- **Final Acceptance:** If **‚â•60%** of the successful nodes are within the `MAX_ACCEPTABLE_DISTANCE (10.0)` of the Best Fit Candidate, the result is accepted.

- **Tie-Breaker:** If multiple nodes tie for the lowest RDS, the **fastest-responding node (lowest latency)** is selected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

The MVP is implemented in **Node.js** to simulate the asynchronous fetch and aggregation logic.

### üîß Configuration Thresholds

| Setting                  | Value   | Rationale                                       |
|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `N_NODES`                | 100      | Simulated network size                          |
| `CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD_PCT`| 60%     | Required network agreement (6 out of 10 nodes)  |
| `MAX_ACCEPTABLE_DISTANCE`| 10.0    | Strict distance tolerance                       |

> This threshold enforces near-zero tolerance for string/structural mismatches and very low numeric volatility. it Could still be heavily improved.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Simulation

```bash
# Clone or download the script
# Run the simulation (the script does not require external arguments as it mocks all data)
# check src/mockAPI to set testing to real API
npm start
